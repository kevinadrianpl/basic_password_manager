# Basic Password Manager

This is a simple password manager written in Python, making use of the Tkinter module and a SQLite database to manage passwords for multiple applications. 

### DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION AS THIS IS IN PLAINTEXT AND UNENCRYPTED.
### This application lacks encryption, a search feature and user authentication.

So DO NOT use this in a production environment or personal use as it is very insecure and lacks many features that traditional password managers are equipped with. 
This was done as a test application.

The passwords can be stored for different applications, including details required for maintaining the passwords. 

For example, the below can be included and updated in a password record:

    - Application Name 
    - URL
    - Email Address 
    - ID
    - Password
